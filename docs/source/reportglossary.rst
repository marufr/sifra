    typology
        "a system used for putting things into groups according to how they
        are similar : the study of how things can be divided into different
        types". |br|

    critical infrastructure
        Critical Infrastructure are "those physical facilities, supply chains,
        information technologies and communication networks which,
        if destroyed, degraded or rendered unavailable for an extended period,
        would significantly impact on the social or economic wellbeing of the
        nation or affect Australia’s ability to conduct national defence and
        ensure national security." |br|
        Attorney General’s Department, Commonwealth of Australia (2015).
        *Critical Infrastructure Resilience Strategy: Policy Statement*, pg 3.

    facility
        In this document `facility` is used as a shorthand for `critical
        infrastructure (CI) facility`. CI Facilities are physical structures
        with collection of components that work as a system and act as hubs
        for generation, processing, transmission, distribution, storage of
        lifeline products and services. These are high-value assets that are
        essential for the proper functioning of the CI networks and for the
        provisioning of essential services.


    fragility
        Fragility "implies easily damaged or broken, but is often used to
        describe the probability of a stated level of damage for a specific
        hazard, e.g. an earthquake." Fragility measures probability.
		

    fragility function
    fragility curves
        Fragility function is a mathematical function that expresses the
        relationship between the probability of occurrence of some undesirable
        event and some measure of environmental excitation. In our case the the
        undesirable event is a facility or component reaching or exceeding some
        clearly defined limit state, and the environmental excitation is
        an earthquake of a defined intensity measure.


    vulnerability
        Vulnerability refers to the concept of susceptibility of damage for
        a given entity. The entity can be a civil structure, a critical
        infrastructure facility, a component within such a facility, or
        a subset of population within a defined geographical area, etc.
        Vulnerability measures loss.


    vulnerability function
        Vulnerability function is a mathematical function that depicts loss
        as a function of environmental excitation.
        It has several synonyms: vulnerability curves, damage functions,
        loss functions.


    acceleration
        Rate of change of velocity with time.

        
    Acceleration Response Spectrum
        A graphical plot of the maximum acceleration that structures having 
        different characteristics will experience when subjected to a specific 
        earthquake ground motion.

        
    amplitude
        The maximum value of a time-varying quantity.
